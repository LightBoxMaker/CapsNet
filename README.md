# CapsNet

Learn interpretable and disentangled latent representations of MNIST images using CapsNet (Geoffrey Hinton, 2017 Oct). Rather than having uninterpretable neural encodings of hand-written digits, the CapsNet now encodes rotation and scale information only in the first and second dimensions of its image encodings, respectively. 

Special thanks to naturomics for making his CapsNet implementation available online.
